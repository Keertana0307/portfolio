## 1. Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

**Tools:** SAS Enterprise Guide, Excel, Kaggle Dataset

**Objectives:**

* Evaluate whether the average sleep duration aligns with recommended guidelines.
* Compare sleep quality between genders.
* Analyze the effect of BMI on sleep duration.
* Build a predictive model of sleep duration based on lifestyle and health indicators.

**Key Analysis:**

* Performed descriptive analysis (distribution of BMI, sleep duration, activity levels).
* Conducted hypothesis testing (one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, ANOVA).
* Built a multiple linear regression model to predict sleep duration using quality of sleep, age, and physical activity.

**Findings:**

* Average sleep duration (7.13 hours) was slightly higher than the recommended 7 hours.
* Significant gender differences in sleep quality were observed.
* BMI impacted sleep duration, with overweight individuals sleeping less on average.
* Regression model (R¬≤ = 0.79) identified **quality of sleep** as the strongest predictor of sleep duration, followed by age and physical activity.
